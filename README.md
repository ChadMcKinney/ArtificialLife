ArtificialLife
==============

A small C++ library for various generative functions. This code is meant to be dropped into any project or you could build it into an actual library, however there isn't much code. The demo project ArtificialLife.cpp provides some example implementations, but was built using a linux version of Cinder found here: https://github.com/CurtisMcKinney/Cinder/tree/qt. You'll have to work the code to get it to run on any other platform, although it's really just meant to demonstrate how to use some of the functionality in the project.
